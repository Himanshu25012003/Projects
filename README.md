My first project SQLquery1 focusues on data exploration and the database has only two tables in this query, first one is covidDeaths and other one is covidVaccinations and  I had done 
several queries which includes joining the tables, CTE , temp tables, etc.
My second project SQLquery2 focuses on data cleaning , so I only need a single table in this case, I get recommended this table about Nashville housing data from youtube and it was 
perfect for showcasing my data cleaning abilities like doing standardization, UPDATE, CTE, etc.
